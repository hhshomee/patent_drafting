The first component is a three-segmented needle-guide wire composed of a distal needle designed to flex sharply in relation to the conjoined looped guide wire segment after fossa ovalis puncture and needle advancement. The distal guide wire loops are advanced into the left atrium maintaining the angled needle in a central location relevant to the loops for preserving an atraumatic position while stabilizing the loops in the left atrium. The elongated proximal extra stiff guide wire segment is conjoined to the looped segment which crosses the fossa ovalis and extends proximally to become externalized to the femoral vein.
