This patent describes a system for classifying Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) based on both metadata and cardiovascular signals, particularly Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. The system leverages a metadata-based rule engine to categorize subjects as confirmed CAD, CAD, or non-CAD. By analyzing metadata and identifying optimal parameters associated with CAD, the system computes optimal thresholds using an inflexion point-based correlation analysis. These thresholds enable the system to effectively classify subjects into the appropriate categories.

Moreover, for CAD subjects, the system employs a dual approach by incorporating both a PPG signal classifier and a PCG signal classifier. These classifiers are used in parallel to extract parameters from the respective signals and calculate confidence scores. The subject is then reclassified as either confirmed CAD or non-CAD based on the highest confidence score, combining the insights obtained from both modalities. This approach provides a more comprehensive and accurate classification of CAD."

This invention relates to a method for reshaping a native vein to reduce its diameter and make it more prone to bending or compression in response to an external force. The method involves using a cannula to deliver an implant into the vein, the implant comprising a single wire-like body having a distal coil and a proximal coil. The distal coil is released to expand and anchor the implant on the exterior surface of the vein, and the proximal coil is then drawn proximally to pull the distal coil against the vein wall and partially collapse the lumen of the vein. The proximal coil is then released to expand and anchor the implant on the exterior surface of the vein, maintaining the partial collapse of the lumen. The implant compresses opposed walls of the vein such that a length across a central region of the vein is reduced to less than the diameter of the unconstrained vein but blood flow is not blocked. The compressed shape makes the vein more prone to external forces which cause a decrease or temporary stoppage of blood flow through the vein."
