The device comprises a torso connection member, a forearm support member, and a dynamic tensioning assembly. The torso connection member is securable to a patient's torso, while the forearm support member couples with at least one forearm of the patient and fixes an elbow of the patient proximate the torso. The forearm support member is pivotally coupled to the torso connection member, allowing for a dynamic angle between the two. The dynamic tensioning assembly includes a dial, an elastomeric or resilient strap, and an anchor point located between the wrist and elbow of the patient. When the patient turns the dial, the cable is drawn into the dial and pulls on the elastomeric or resilient strap, which exerts an outwardly directed force on the forearm support member at the anchor point, resulting in external rotation of the forearm support member and stretching of the shoulder capsule. The device can be used to treat adhesive capsulitis by reducing the angle between the forearm support member and the coronal plane of the patient, thereby stretching the shoulder capsule and improving range of motion.\",\n          \"  The present invention relates to a system for generating an aqueous ozone solution for cleaning purposes and purified water for consumption, comprising an enclosure with openings for a water inlet and an aqueous ozone solution outlet, one or more ozone generators disposed within the enclosure, a fluid mixer configured to inject ozone generated by the ozone generators into water received from a water source via the water inlet, a first splitter fluidically coupled to the aqueous ozone solution outlet, a spray gun configured to dispense a first portion of the aqueous ozone solution received via the first splitter for disinfecting or degreasing surfaces or articles in proximity of the aqueous ozone solution outlet, and a janitorial fill station including a first faucet fluidically coupled to the second splitter and configured to dispense a second portion of the aqueous ozone solution received via the first and second splitters from the aqueous ozone solution outlet, a carbon filter fluidically coupled to the second splitter and configured to reduce an ozone concentration of a third portion of the aqueous ozone solution received via the first and second splitters from the aqueous ozone solution outlet to produce purified water for consumption, and a second faucet fluidically coupled to the carbon filter and configured to dispense the purified water.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
